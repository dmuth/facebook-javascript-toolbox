# Facebook Javascript Toolbox

Javascript helper tools for Facebook groups that I run.

## FB Group Tools
I wrote this [for a group that I run](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FurriesInLove/) which happens to have over 30,000 members, and substantial spam load.

- [fb-group-tools.js](https://github.com/dmuth/facebook-javascript-toolbox/blob/main/fb-group-tools.js)
  - Adds the following buttons to Facebook Groups
    - "Give Feedback"
    - "Report Post To Admins"
    - "Toggle Comments off/on"
    - "Toggle Post Approval on/off"
